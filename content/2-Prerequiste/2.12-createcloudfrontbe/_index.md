### Create a CloudFront Distribution for the Backend

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Objective**

*   **Amazon CloudFront** is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that helps speed up and secure web applications.
*   In this step, we will create a CloudFront distribution to act as the public "gateway" for our backend API, instead of allowing users to access the ALB directly.
*   **Key Benefits:**
    *   **HTTPS:** CloudFront will provide a secure HTTPS endpoint for users. It will communicate with the ALB over HTTP within the AWS internal network, simplifying SSL certificate management.
    *   **Performance:** CloudFront brings your API closer to users through its global network of Edge Locations, reducing latency.
    *   **Security:** It provides an additional layer of protection, hiding the ALB's actual address, and can be integrated with AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) later.

üîí **Steps to Follow**

#### **1. Start Creating the Distribution**

*   From the **AWS Management Console**, search for and select the **CloudFront** service.
*   Click on **Create a CloudFront distribution**.

#### **2. Configure the Origin**

*   **Origin domain:** Click in the box and select the DNS name of the Application Load Balancer `ors-alb` from the dropdown list.
*   **Protocol:** Select `HTTP only`.
*   **HTTP port:** Leave the default as `80`.

**How it works:**
User `--(HTTPS)-->` **CloudFront** `--(HTTP, port 80)-->` **ALB**.
CloudFront will handle the secure HTTPS connection, and then "talk" to the ALB using regular HTTP.

#### **3. Configure the Default Cache Behavior**

*   This is the most critical configuration part to ensure the API works correctly.
*   In the **Behaviors** tab, select `Default (*)` and click **Edit**.
*   **Cache policy:** Select `CachingDisabled`. This is very important because we do not want CloudFront to cache API responses (which are dynamic and change frequently).
*   **Origin request policy - optional:** Select `AllViewer`. This policy forwards all information from the user (headers, query strings, cookies) to the ALB, ensuring the backend receives all the data it needs to process requests.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Select `Do not enable security protections` for the purpose of this workshop.
*   Click **Save changes**.

#### **4. Finalize, Deploy, and Test**

*   Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Create distribution**.
*   The process of deploying a new distribution across CloudFront's entire network can take 5 to 15 minutes. You will see the status as `Deploying`.

*   When the status changes to show a **Last modified** date, copy the **Distribution domain name** (e.g., `d12345abcdef.cloudfront.net`).

*   Paste this domain name into your browser. The response should be identical to when you accessed the ALB's DNS: `Welcome to Dining Verse Backend API!`. This confirms that CloudFront has been successfully configured to act as a proxy for your ALB.

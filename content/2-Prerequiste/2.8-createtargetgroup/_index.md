### Create a Target Group

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Objective**

*   A **Target Group** is used to group together EC2 instances that the **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** will route traffic to.
*   The ALB also uses the Target Group to perform **Health Checks**, ensuring that it only sends requests to instances that are operating normally.
*   We will create a Target Group to manage all the web servers for the restaurant project.

---

üîí **Steps to Follow**

#### **1. Access Target Groups**

*   From the **EC2 Dashboard**, on the left menu, scroll down to the **Load Balancing** section and select **Target Groups**.
*   Click on **Create target group**.

#### **2. Choose a Target Type**

*   In the **Choose a target type** step, select **Instances**, as we want the Load Balancer to route traffic to EC2 instances.
*   Click **Next**.

#### **3. Configure Details for the Target Group**

*   **Target group name:** `ors-target-group`
*   **Protocol - Port:** Select `HTTP` and enter `5000`. This is the port our Node.js backend application will be listening on.
*   **VPC:** Select `ors-vpc`.
*   **Health checks:**
    *   **Health check protocol:** `HTTP`
    *   **Health check path:** `/health`.

**What is a Health Check Path?**
This is a special endpoint that you need to create in your backend code. The Application Load Balancer will continuously send requests to this `/health` path. If it receives a successful response (HTTP 200 OK), it will consider the instance "healthy" and continue sending user traffic to it. If not, it will temporarily stop sending traffic to allow the instance to recover.

#### **4. Register Initial Targets**

*   In this step, we will register the manually created `ors-ec2` instance into the Target Group.
*   In the **Available instances** table, select `ors-ec2`.
*   Click on **Include as pending below**. This action will add the instance to the pending list to be registered with the group.

**Why register an initial instance?**
This helps us verify that the Load Balancer and Target Group are working correctly right after configuration. Instances created later will be automatically registered into this Target Group by the **Auto Scaling Group**.

#### **5. Finalize and Review**

*   Scroll down and click **Create target group**.
*   After successful creation, you will be taken to the details page of the Target Group. Initially, the **Health status** of the instance might be `initial` or `unhealthy`.
*   Please wait a few minutes for the Load Balancer to perform its health checks, and the status will change to `healthy`.

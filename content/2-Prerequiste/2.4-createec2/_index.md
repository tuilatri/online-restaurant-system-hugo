### Launch an Initial EC2 Instance for Configuration

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Objective**

*   Launch a first virtual server (**EC2 Instance**), named `ors-ec2`.
*   This server will be placed in a **Public Subnet** so that we can access it to install the environment (Node.js, Git, etc.) and configure the application.
*   Once completed, this instance will be used as a "blueprint" to create an **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)** for automatic scaling later on.

---

üîí **Steps to Follow**

#### **1. Start Launching the Instance**

*   In the **AWS Management Console**, find and select the **EC2** service.
*   From the **EC2 Dashboard**, click the **Launch instance** button.

#### **2. Name the Instance and Choose an AMI**

*   **Name:** `ors-ec2`
*   **Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image):** Choose **Amazon Linux**. This operating system is optimized for AWS and is highly compatible with the tools we will be using.

#### **3. Choose an Instance Type**

*   **Instance type:** Select `t2.micro`. This instance type is part of the AWS **Free Tier**, making it suitable for learning and development.

#### **4. Create a Key Pair for Access**

*   This is an **extremely important** step to be able to connect to the server via SSH.
*   In the **Key pair (login)** section, click on **Create new key pair**.
*   **Key pair name:** `ors-keypair`
*   **Key pair type:** `RSA`
*   **Private key file format:** `.pem` (for use with MobaXterm or Terminal on macOS/Linux).
*   Click **Create key pair**, and the browser will automatically download the `ors-keypair.pem` file.

**IMPORTANT:** Store this `.pem` file in a safe place and never share it. You **cannot download** this file a second time. If you lose it, you will lose access to your EC2 instance.

#### **5. Configure Network Settings**

*   Click the **Edit** button in the **Network settings** section.
*   **VPC:** Select the `ors-vpc` you created.
*   **Subnet:** Choose one of the two configured **Public Subnets** (e.g., `ors-vpc-subnet-public1-ap-southeast-1a`).
*   **Auto-assign public IP:** `Enable`. (This is why we configured the subnet in step 2.2).
*   **Firewall (security groups):** Choose **Select existing security group**.
*   From the **Common security groups** list, select `ors-sg` which we created in step 2.3.

#### **6. Launch and Check the Instance**

*   Review the configured information in the **Summary** panel on the right.
*   Click **Launch instance**.
*   After a successful launch, you can click **View all instances** to see your `ors-ec2` server.

*   Wait a few minutes until the **Status check** column changes to **2/2 checks passed**. At this point, your server is ready to be connected to.

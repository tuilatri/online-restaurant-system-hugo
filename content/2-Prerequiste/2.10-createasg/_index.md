### Create an Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Objective**

*   An **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** is the heart of a flexible architecture on AWS. Its job is to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances to meet traffic demands.
*   When traffic increases, the ASG will automatically add new instances (**Scale Out**). When traffic decreases, it will remove unneeded instances (**Scale In**) to save costs.
*   We will configure an ASG to use the **Launch Template** (`ors-launch-template`) to know *how* to create an instance, and attach it to the **Load Balancer** (via the Target Group) to know *when* to take action.

üîí **Steps to Follow**

#### **1. Start Creating the Auto Scaling Group**

*   From the **EC2 Dashboard**, on the left menu, scroll to the bottom and select **Auto Scaling Groups**.
*   Click on **Create Auto Scaling group**.

#### **2. Choose Launch Template and Name the Group**

*   **Auto Scaling group name:** `ors-asg`
*   **Launch template:** Select `ors-launch-template` from the list.
*   After selecting, click **Next**.

#### **3. Configure Network**

*   **VPC:** Select `ors-vpc`.
*   **Availability Zones and subnets:** Select both **Public Subnets** that we have. The ASG will use these subnets to launch new instances, ensuring they are evenly distributed across two AZs for high availability.
*   Click **Next**.

#### **4. Integrate with the Load Balancer**

*   Select **Attach to an existing load balancer**.
*   Choose **Choose from your load balancer target groups**.
*   From the dropdown list, select `ors-target-group`.
*   Click **Next**.

#### **5. Configure Group Size and Scaling Policies**

*   **Group size:**
    *   **Desired capacity:** `1` (The desired number of instances when the ASG is created).
    *   **Minimum capacity:** `1` (Always maintain at least 1 instance).
    *   **Maximum capacity:** `2` (Allow a maximum of 2 instances to be created).

*   **Scaling policies:**
    *   Select **Target tracking scaling policy**.
    *   **Scaling policy name:** `Target Tracking Policy`
    *   **Metric type:** `Application Load Balancer request count per target`.
    *   **Target value:** `30`.

**How does this policy work?**
You are instructing the ASG: "Monitor the average number of requests that each EC2 instance is handling. If this number **exceeds 30 requests/minute**, automatically create a new instance (up to a maximum of 2) to share the load. Conversely, if it is lower than 30, reduce the number of instances (down to a minimum of 1) to save money."

*   Click **Next** until you reach the **Review** page.

#### **6. Review and Finalize**

*   Review all the configured information on the **Review** page.
*   Scroll to the bottom and click **Create Auto Scaling group**.

#### **7. Check the Result**

*   After creation, the ASG will appear in the list.
*   Select `ors-asg` and switch to the **Instance management** tab.
*   You will see the ASG is in the process of launching a new instance to meet the **Desired capacity** of `1`. Please wait until the instance's **Lifecycle** is `InService`. This indicates that the instance is ready and has been successfully registered with the Target Group.

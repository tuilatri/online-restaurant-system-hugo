### Create an AMI from the Configured EC2 Instance

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Objective**

*   An **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** is a "snapshot" or a complete backup of an EC2 instance, including the operating system, installed software, and all configurations.
*   The purpose of creating an AMI in this workshop is to have a **standard "blueprint"** for the web server. This blueprint will be used by the **Launch Template** and **Auto Scaling Group** in later steps to automatically create identical copies of the server when scaling is needed.

üîí **Steps to Follow**

#### **1. Select the Source EC2 Instance**

*   In the **EC2 Dashboard**, navigate to **Instances**.
*   From the list, select the `ors-ec2` instance that you have created and will configure in the following steps.

#### **2. Start the Image Creation Process**

*   After selecting the instance, click on the **Actions** menu.
*   Choose **Image and templates**.
*   Select **Create image**.

#### **3. Configure Information for the AMI**

*   On the **Create image** page, fill in the following information:
    *   **Image name:** `ors-ami`
    *   **Image description:** `ors-ami`
*   Other options can be left as default. This ensures the AMI will retain the entire configuration of the original instance.

#### **4. Finalize and Check the Status**

*   Scroll down and click **Create image**.
*   You will receive a notification that the AMI creation request has been submitted successfully.


*   To monitor the progress:
    *   On the left menu, under the **Images** section, select **AMIs**.
    *   You will see the `ors-ami` AMI in a `pending` state.
    *   This process may take a few minutes. Please wait until the **Status** column changes to `Available`.

Excellent! You have successfully created a complete server blueprint. Any EC2 instance created from this AMI will have everything you've installed, ready to serve users immediately.

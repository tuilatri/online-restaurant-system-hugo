### Create an S3 Bucket to Store the Frontend

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Objective**

*   **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** is an object storage service that offers scalability, high durability, and low cost.
*   We will use S3 to store all the static files of our frontend application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images).
*   Afterward, we will configure this bucket to function as a **Static Website Hosting** server.

üîí **Steps to Follow**

#### **1. Start Creating the S3 Bucket**

#### **2. Configure the Bucket**

*   **Bucket name:** `ors-fe`
    {{% notice warning %}}
    S3 bucket names are globally unique. If the name `ors-fe` is already in use, you will need to add characters or numbers to make it unique (e.g., `ors-fe-haminhtri-0309`).

*   **AWS Region:** Choose the region you are working in.

*   **Block Public Access settings for this bucket:**
    *   **Check** the box for **Block all public access**.

### Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB)

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Objective**

*   The **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** acts as the single point of contact for clients and distributes incoming application traffic to the backend servers.
*   By placing the ALB in **Public Subnets** across multiple Availability Zones (AZs), we ensure the application has **High Availability**. If one AZ experiences an issue, the ALB will automatically redirect traffic to the servers in the remaining AZ.
*   The ALB will listen for incoming requests and forward them to the **Target Group** (`ors-target-group`) that we created in the previous step.

üîí **Steps to Follow**

#### **1. Start Creating the Load Balancer**

*   From the **EC2 Dashboard**, on the left menu, scroll down to the **Load Balancing** section and select **Load Balancers**.
*   Click on **Create load balancer**.

#### **2. Choose the Load Balancer Type**

*   Since our application operates at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS), select **Application Load Balancer** by clicking **Create**.

#### **3. Configure Basic Information**

*   **Load balancer name:** `ors-alb`
*   **Scheme:** `Internet-facing` (Because this ALB will receive traffic directly from the Internet).
*   **IP address type:** `IPv4`

#### **4. Configure Network Mapping**

*   This is a crucial step to ensure the ALB operates across multiple AZs and is accessible from the Internet.
*   **VPC:** Select `ors-vpc`.
*   **Mappings:** Select both Availability Zones that we are using. For each AZ, choose the corresponding **Public Subnet** (e.g., `subnet-public1` for `ap-southeast-1a` and `subnet-public2` for `ap-southeast-1b`).

#### **5. Configure Security Group**

*   In the **Security groups** section, keep the `default` Security Group selected.
*   From the dropdown list, select the Security Group created specifically for the Web Server: `ors-sg`.

#### **6. Configure Listeners and Routing**

*   This is where we define how the ALB handles incoming requests.
*   **Listener:** Keep `HTTP` and Port `80` as is.
*   **Default action:** From the dropdown list, select the `ors-target-group` created in the previous step. This action instructs the ALB to forward all traffic from port 80 to this Target Group.

#### **7. Finalize, Check Status, and Test Access**

*   Review the information in the **Summary** section and click **Create load balancer**.
*   After successful creation, click **View load balancer**.

**Note:** The process of provisioning a Load Balancer will take a few minutes. Its state will change from `provisioning` to `active`. Please be patient.

*   Once the ALB is `active`, select it and copy the **DNS name** from the **Details** tab.

*   After you connect to the Backend and upload the project, you will see the result of the next step.
*   Paste this DNS name into your browser. If everything is configured correctly and your backend application is running on the `ors-ec2` instance, you will see the welcome message from the API: `Welcome to Dining Verse Backend API!`
